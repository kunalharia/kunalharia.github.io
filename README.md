Notes:

* GIT = version control tool
* github = social code-hosting platform
* RStudio projects => multiple contexts, each with their own working directory, workspace, history, and source documents - test

### Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster

[Github](https://github.com/kunalharia/kunalharia.github.io/blob/master/ipynb/StatusToday%20-%20binary%20classification%20task%20-%20by%20Kunal.ipynb) [nbviewer](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/kunalharia/kunalharia.github.io/blob/master/ipynb/StatusToday%20-%20binary%20classification%20task%20-%20by%20Kunal.ipynb)

Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster is a knowledge competition on Kaggle. Many people started practicing in machine learning with this competition, so did I. This is a binary classification problem: based on information about Titanic passengers we predict whether they survived or not. General description and data are available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic).
Titanic dataset provides interesting opportunities for feature engineering.
